Union and Intersection Analysis:

I used sets to get unique values out of each provided linked list
Then I used the set functions: Union and Intersection according to the required 
action. Finally I appened the newly created set values to a new linkedslist

Time Complexity: O(n + m) -> O(n) as I loop through sets of combined unique values to append them to the linked list

Space-Complexity: O(n + m) -> o(n) as I created newly sets to store unique values of before appending them to the linked list
